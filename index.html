    <p><i>Interesting Facts About Cicada</i></p>
</centre>

    
<ul>
        
<li>The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.</li>
<li>Cicadas kind of ‘sweat’-They feed on plant sap, so they are constantly sucking in liquids, and as the temperature gets hotter and hotter, and they start to overheat, they remove the water from their blood and pass it through ducts in their body. As it exits their body through pores on their thorax, they get that continuous evaporative cooling.</li>
<li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes</li>
